# RCV PROJECT FRONTEND

This is a very temporary README for the Ranked Choice Voting frontend for the Equal Citizens project. 

---

Changelog:
* Wed. Apr. 10, 2019
Project started. Here's the tech stack:

* React / Redux
Seriously thought about using Vue, but as I'm hoping to bring in volunteers looking to put some experience under their belt, and React is a more widely known framework, I'm building it with React/Redux.  

* Javascript
Eventually, a goal will be to move to Typescript for better maintainability, but for right now, as an MVP, we'll be starting with basic Javascript. This is to both onboard people who might not be comfortable with Typescript as well as work well with the authentication software of Auth0.  

* Front-End Only
The backend will be handled via a seperate repository. 

* Jest (Unit Testing)
Jest is the default testing package for Create React App.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
